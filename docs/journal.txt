The "elevator pitch" is that we expose the iN LLVM-IR integer types in Clang such that a sufficiently motivated code generator could take advantage of the smaller sizes.  This is particularly useful for FPGAs, though I'd imagine other users are around.



So I wonder how Tuppence could take advantage of this?
